# Advanced ActiveRecord Querying / Advanced Activerecord Querying Belongs_to Associations

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Advanced ActiveRecord Querying](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/advanced-activerecord-querying) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll be using ActiveRecord's `join` and `merge` methods to query your `belongs_to` associations in an object-oriented, composable way.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/advanced-activerecord-querying-belongs_to-associations.git
    cd advanced-activerecord-querying-belongs_to-associations
    bin/setup

After cloning and running `bin/setup`:

* Take a look in `db/schema.rb` to get a sense of the database schema you'll be querying.
* Take a look at the classes in `app/models` to get familiar with the models and associations you'll be working with.
* Edit `spec/models/location_spec.rb` and remove the `pending` line from the spec.
* Edit `app/models/location.rb` and implement `in_region` to get the spec passing.
* Edit `spec/models/person_spec.rb` and repeat the above process for each pending spec.

You can run `rake` to re-run the tests at any time.

Once all the tests are passing (and there are no pending specs), you're all set!
